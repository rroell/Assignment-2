# Applied Machine Learning assignment 2
Introduction
Lineage logistics, is one of the world's largest logistics companies. Their data science team at its current capacity contains around 27 Ph.D's working full time on a variety of problems. One of which will be your problem set 2!

before diving into the problem it self, please note that this is a real world data set, i.e., this is something you will easily get on your first day as a promising new data scientist, from the data, to how you approach the problem to the tools that you use. Please think of this as a surrogate to such a scenario or even one of your future  job interviews!

Problem description
The core of Lineage is in fact cold storage, how you store, ship, and handle food medicine etc. Today lineage has almost 30000 cold storage warehouses globally, and as we have recently, power consumption of cold/warm systems is a non trivial manner.

A refrigerated warehouse's largest energy usage comes from its refrigeration system. Depending on the size of the facility these refrigeration units can use somewhere between 4000-8000 kW at any given time. Given the number of warehouses in Lineage's portfolio identifying opportunities to reduce the energy consumption, even by a moderate fraction, can add up to a huge impact in overall energy usage.
